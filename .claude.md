## Tech Stack
- HTML5 Canvas for games requiring pixel-perfect rendering
- Tailwind CSS via CDN: `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>`
- Vanilla JavaScript ES6+ (no frameworks, no build tools)
- Mobile responsive where applicable

## Game Development Rules
1. Each game is fully self-contained in its own folder
2. Each game has its own assets/ folder (no shared assets)
3. Always split into: index.html, style.css, script.js
4. Use Tailwind for UI/menus, Canvas for game rendering
5. Include Tailwind CDN in every HTML file
6. Games must be playable immediately (no external dependencies)

## Branding
- Footer attribution: "Built by AISLE Partners using Claude Code"
- Tagline: "AISLE Partners. AI Strategy. Leverage. Execution."
- Include on both individual games and menu page

## Current Task
Building Space Invaders next
